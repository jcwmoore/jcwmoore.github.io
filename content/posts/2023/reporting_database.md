## A Service Now Metrics Problem

In early 2023, leadership decided that my team (and my peers) would invest in agile 
practices. 

The base Service Now package with the Agile toolkit is an excellent ITSM system, an average work tracking system for SDE teams, and a terrible data historian. For my team, Service Now works fine for documenting user stories, documenting how many stories (and points) were in a sprint at the start, and how many stories/points were completed in a sprint. But it falls short on tracking how things change through out the sprint. If the product owner re-prioritizes a story mid-sprint, adding one and removing two, that story is lost in the out of the box metrics Service Now can produce. Unfortunately, those type of changes are exactly the metrics leadership was interested in. After the first sprint, the metrics complied by hand and plotted on a [mural](https://app.mural.co) board, example below.
